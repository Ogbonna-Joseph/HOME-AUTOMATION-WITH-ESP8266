# HOME-AUTOMATION-WITH-ESP8266
In this project we learn how to make IoT Based Home Automation using **ESP8266 Web Server** . By Home Automation we mean controlling lighting and appliances without any manual switch but using the system that is connected to Internet. When connected with the Internet, home devices are an important constituent of the Internet of Things (“IoT”).
